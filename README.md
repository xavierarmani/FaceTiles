# FaceTiles

The application draws a set of 100 faces arranged in a matrix of 10 rows and 10 columns. The faces are randomly generated using a class called FaceRandomizer. Clicking the Randomize button at the bottom will change the faces to random smiles and colors. 

The application also features a main menu. The File menu has two menu items, Save and Exit. The Save menu item saves information about the faces (their row, column, mouth type, and color components, all of which are included in the Face classâ€™ toString representation) to a file named faces.txt. The Exit menu item closes the program. The other menu on the main menu bar is the Edit menu. The Edit menu has a Randomize menu item that does the same thing as the Randomize button at the bottom of the frame.
